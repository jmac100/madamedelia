            <h3>Here are a few suggestions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>review notes of recent lessons</li>
                <li>review unit vocabulary: make yourself a quiz, pair up with a friend, make flashcards, create a word search and exchange with a friend</li>
                <li>read a book (visit our school library as we are building our French section in the library) We have some comic books and easy graphic novels - the public library offers many French books</li>
                <li>listen to French radio (90.3 FM for example)</li>
                <li>organize loose papers (remember that everything has its place)</li>
